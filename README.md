## How To;

1. Make yourself a branch for the username/day e.g.  `git switch -c jackbennett/1`
1. Make a folder of your username to solve each day under in your chosen languages and crack on i.e. `./Jackbennett/`
    - It's up to you and your chosen language for studcture from here. Do it as a folder per day, or one big program etc.
    - Be mindful to make it easy of others to browse your answers day-by-day
1. Put as many commits as you like onto your branch `git commit -am "Complete working solution first time."`
1. Push this branch back to github & create a `Pull Request` into `main` e.g. `git push origin Jackbennett/1`

When your attempt is in PR, checkout other submissions.

Once all are in PR or before the next challenge the PR's wil be merged into main. Next you want to get setup for the next.

## Example;

```bash
git clone https://github.com/watsonmarlow/AdventOfCode.git && cd AdventOFCode
mkdir Jackbennett && cd Jackbennett
git switch -c Jackbennett/1

# Make a start on day 1

git commit -am "First try!"

# Share

git push origin Jackbennett/1

# Got to github and open pull request to main


# Day 2
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c Jackbennett/2

# You know the drill
```
